# ðŸ§© MonoKit

> A lightweight and modular game framework built on **MonoGame**.  
> MonoKit provides essential building blocks for 2D games â€” including content management, rendering, input handling, and UI components.

MonoKit is **not a complete game engine** â€” itâ€™s a collection of building blocks meant to help you start small and learn how engines are structured.  
It focuses on:
- Simplicity over performance  
- Readability over abstraction  
- Modularity without overengineering

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**MonoKit** is a simple game development library built on top of **MonoGame**, created for learning and small to medium 2D projects.  
It offers a structured foundation without being a full-blown engine, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize.

### âœ¨ Features
- **Core utilities** â€” file handling, RNG, frame counter, JSON helpers  
- **Content system** â€” audio, settings, and content management  
- **Rendering** â€” simple 2D renderer with post-processing support  
- **Input** â€” keyboard and mouse abstraction layer  
- **Gameplay** â€” object management, spatial hashing, and logic helpers  
- **UI toolkit** â€” basic UI components (buttons, sliders, text, frames)  
- **Camera system** â€” 2D and 3D camera classes  
- **Runtime** â€” screens and runtime container management
