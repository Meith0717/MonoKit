# 🧩 MonoKit

> A lightweight and modular game framework built on **MonoGame**.  
> MonoKit provides essential building blocks for 2D games — including content management, rendering, input handling, and
> UI components.

MonoKit is **not a complete game engine** — it’s a collection of building blocks meant to help you start small and learn
how engines are structured.  
It focuses on:

- Simplicity over performance
- Readability over abstraction
- Modularity without overengineering

## 🌟 Overview

**MonoKit** is a simple game development library built on top of **MonoGame**, created for learning and small to medium
2D projects.  
It offers a structured foundation without being a full-blown engine, making it easy to understand, extend, and
customize.

### ✨ Features

- **Core utilities** — file handling, RNG, frame counter, JSON helpers
- **Content system** — audio, settings, and content management
- **Rendering** — simple 2D renderer with post-processing support
- **Input** — keyboard and mouse abstraction layer
- **Gameplay** — object management, spatial hashing, and logic helpers
- **UI toolkit** — basic UI components (buttons, sliders, text, frames)
- **Camera system** — 2D and 3D camera classes
- **Runtime** — screens and runtime container management
